      <p>
        Hi! My name is Prashanti and I am currently a rising sophomore at 
        Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science. I am a 
        computer science major and either an additional major or minor in math. 
        I love problem solving, algorithm design, discrete math, and typesetting
        proofs (its so satisfying!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a STEP intern at Google with the Surveys team.
        I also am a teaching assistant at CMU. I was a TA for 15-122
        (Principles of Imperative Computation) for Spring 2020 and will
        be a TA for 15-251 (Great Theoretical Ideas in CS) in the fall 2020
        semester. My responsibilities for 15-122 included grading assignments,
        teaching a lab, and designing written assignments. I have also previously
        been involved with robotics through FRC and VEX.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In my free time I play lots of board/card 
        games (Avalon, Settlers of Catan, Dominion, and more!), slowly make my 
        way through the local library's science fiction and fantasy section, 
        and waste time on Discord. I also play the flute and occasionally bring
        out my old Phantom of the Opera sheet music for piano when I'm bored.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I will read almost anything, but some of my favorites are <i>Harry Potter</i>,
        anything written by Brandon Sanderson, and <i>I'll Give You the Sun</i>. I'm a really
        big fan of the <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/what-is-the-cosmere/">Cosmere</a>
        and can often be found listening to Shardcast or browsing the Seventeenth Shard.

	  <p>
            I was part of robotics for all four years of high school. I first joined my school's FRC
            team during my freshman year as part of the software subteam. As part of the team I worked on 
	    test driven development for our new flexible framework, autonomous pathing and robot control,
	    self calibrating subsystems, and much more. My technical experience focused on effective testing
	    and control theory.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition, I lead outreach efforts such as our FTC and FLL mentoring program. The program supported
	    two FTC teams with biweekly meetings and mentorship and started six FLL teams. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition to my involvement with FRC, I was also part of the VEX program for six years. In tenth grade
            I started a VEX team at my high school to expand the robotics program and the number of students it could
            reach. The program included two VEX robots which competing anually in the VRC competition. They won the Judges
            award during my senior year.
          </p>
	  <p>
	    In addition to communicating with the school, securing space, recruiting members, and managing logistics, I was
	    also heavily involved with the design, creation, and programming of the robots. I have significant experience
	    with VEX design as well as leveraging my control theory knowledge from FRC to build a better product and
	    help my teammates grow.

	  <img src="images/122_staff.jpg" alt="Course Staff for 15-122 Spring 2020" class="project-image"/>
	  <p>
	    I am a teaching assistant at Carnegie Mellon Unversity. In Spring 2020 I was on the 15-122 course staff, where I helped
            grade assignments, taught a lab, and redesigned written assignments. The class teaches how to reason about code and 
	    correctness, basic data structures, and programming in C. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the fall I will be joining the 15-251 course staff. The class covers mathematical models of computation and provides
	    a broad introduction to computer science theory including P vs. NP, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, 
	    Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and a variety of other topics which vary by semester. This has been my favorite class at 
	    Carnegie Mellon so far and I'm excited to be a part of the team and for (hopefully) in person recitations!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I hope to broaden and reinforce my knowledge of CS theory in this position by helping students and interacting with all
	    the amazing, intelligent, and insanely talented other TAs. As I learn more about computer science theory I want to use this
	    as a stepping stone to get involved with research in the area.
