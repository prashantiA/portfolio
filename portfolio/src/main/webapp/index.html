      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Prashanti and I am currently a rising sophomore at 
        Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science. I am a 
        computer science major and plan to do a concentration in Algorithms 
        and Complexity as well as either an additional major or minor in math. 
        I love problem solving, algorithm design, discrete math, and typesetting
        proofs (its so satisfying!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a STEP intern at Google with the Surveys team.
        I also am a teaching assistant at CMU. I was a TA for 15-122
        (Principles of Imperative Computation) for Spring 2020 and will
        be a TA for 15-251 (Great Theoretical Ideas in CS) in the fall 2020
        semester. My responsibilities for 15-122 included grading assignments,
        teaching a lab, and designing written assignments. I have also previously
        been involved with robotics through FRC and VEX.
      </p>
      <p> 
        In my free time I play lots of board/card 
        games (Avalon, Settlers of Catan, Dominion, and more!), slowly make my 
        way through the local library's science fiction and fantasy section, 
        and waste time on Discord. I also play the flute and occasionally bring
        out my old Phantom of the Opera sheet music for piano when I'm bored.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I will read almost anything, but some of my favorites are <i>Harry Potter</i>,
        anything written by Brandon Sanderson, and <i>I'll Give You the Sun</i>. I'm a really
        big fan of the <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/what-is-the-cosmere/">Cosmere</a>
        and can often be found listening to Shardcast or browsing the Seventeenth Shard.
