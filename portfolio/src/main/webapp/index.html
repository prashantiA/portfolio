      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Prashanti and I am currently a rising sophomore at 
      Carnegie Mellon University in the School of Computer Science. I am a 
      computer science major and plan to do a concentration in Algorithms 
      and Complexity as well as either an additional major or minor in math. 
      I love problem solving, algorithm design, discrete math, and typesetting
      proofs (its so satisfying!).</p>
      <p>I am currently a STEP intern at Google with the Surveys team.
      I also am a teaching assistant at CMU. I was a TA for 15-122
      (Principles of Imperative Computation) for Spring 2020 and will
      be a TA for 15-251 (Great Theoretical Ideas in CS) in the fall 2020
      semester. My responsibilities for 15-122 included grading assignments,
      teaching a lab, and designing written assignments. I have also previously
      been involved with robotics through FRC and VEX.</p>
      <p> In my free time I play lots of board/card 
      games (Avalon, Settlers of Catan, Dominion, and more!), slowly make my 
      way through the local library's science fiction and fantasy section, 
      and waste time on Discord.</p>
